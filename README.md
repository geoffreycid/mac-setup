# macOS Setup that suit my needs

This repository has been forked from [dvLden's
work](https://github.com/dvLden/macOS-Setup).

## Information
Please, do not use my setup as is. If you want to give it a try, I suggest you
to fork my repo first, review the code, change it and tweak it to your needs.
Don't just blindly run it, because it may not be something that you want/need.

## Installation
`mkdir ~/.dot && curl -L "https://github.com/geoffreycid/macOS-Setup/tarball/master" | tar -xz -C ~/.dot --strip-components=1 && cd ~/.dot && sh bootstrap`
